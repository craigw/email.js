email.js
========

Email generation and parsing in Javascript.

Why?
----

Javascript is starting to break out of it's perceived roll as a
browser-based client-side-only language. I've been playing with node.js
for the past few weeks and it's rather nice. I'd quite like to send
and receive email in my node.js[1] application.

email.js is implemented as a CommonJS[2] module. Use it like this:

  var email = require("/path/to/email.js"),
      sys   = require("sys");
  var message = email.message(message_source);
  sys.puts("Got an email from " + message.from + ":\n" + message.body);

Also exposed are the email to and subject headers.

It's all rather simplistic at the moment, but I'd like it to be able to
handle most if not all emails - including attachments.

Contributing
------------

  * Fork the project.
  * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
  * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
    future version unintentionally.
  * Make sure all the tests pass.
  * Commit and push your changes.
  * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

Testing
-------

We use my fork of spectacular[3] for testing. It's setup as a submodule
so you'll get it by running `git submodule init && git submodule update`
in the project directory.

Run the tests like this:

  cd /path/to/email.js
  node vendor/spectacular/tacular.js

All tests must pass for a change to be committed to the master branch.
